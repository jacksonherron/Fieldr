<h1>What This Is</h1>
This is a full-stack web app built over four days by Jackson Herron and Eduardo Franco for Project 1 at Gneral Assmemly's Software Engineering Immersive course. In this project we used HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript (including EJS) for the front-end and we used Node for the backend using Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

Every product is a solution to a problem. Jackson and Eduardo wondered to themselves, what problem does every person have that can be easily solved by a website? That's how Fieldr was born!

We all want to go outside, do more physical activities, and get active. Why don't we do it? No one has friends. And if you do you're lying.

Fieldr is like the coolest thing ever. You can find posts of people in your area looking to do physical activites you may be interested in. You can comment on people's posts to let them know you're going to be there. You can cement your commitment by clicking join. Of course we are all flakes so you can unjoin an outing as well. I know what you're thinking "what if I don't want to go on another dog search souling microbrew hike" well you can make your own posts and also delete them when you remember you don't go outside because you hate people.

<h1 style="color: red;" >Getting Started</h1>
First you create an account

Then you log in

Afterwards you can see other people's posts and join or comment at your leisure.

You can post your own outings.

And of course you can see your own profile. (Profile customization is coming out in Fieldr 2.0)

And that's Fieldr. A web app designed to find friends to be physical with. And if you want to date them we won't stop you.
