<h2>What This Is</h2>
This is a full-stack web app built over four days by Jackson Herron and Eduardo Franco at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. This project is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The back-end runs on Node.js with Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. The front-end is built with EJS, custom CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No front-end frameworks are used.

Every product is a solution to a problem... Jackson and Eduardo wondered to themselves, what problem does every person have that can be easily solved by a website? That's how Fieldr was born!

<h2>What This Does</h2>
Fieldr is a web application that helps you find friends to play sports with! You can post about events you are hosting, or find people in your area looking to get a game together. You can comment and join posts to let them know you're going to be there.

We know what you're thinking "what if I don't want to go on another dog search souling microbrew hike" well you can make your own posts and also delete them!

And breathe easy, because your account is secured using bcrypt-salt password hashing, so you know your privacy is safe with Fieldr... That is until quantum computing steamrolls our authentication.
